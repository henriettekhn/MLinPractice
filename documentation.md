# Documentation

In the following we provide an overview of what variants we implemented and why
we chose them.


## Classifiers

- always-true-classifier & always-false-classifier: we implememnted those two 
classifiers to try out how the prediction in the end changes with the classifier 
used. 


## Evaluation metrics

- Precision: It was necessary to implement this metric to calculate the F1-score.
- Recall: It was necessary to implement this metric to calculate the F1-score.
- F1-score: We think that this is a good measure for evaluation and therefore 
implemented it to see how it would change the prediction.
